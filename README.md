# GW Open Data Workshop #5

This repository contains the material to support [GW Open Data Workshop #5](https://www.gw-openscience.org/odw/odw2022).

Firstly, we recommend taking a look at the setup guide, where you can find the information to configure the workspace where you are going to execute the tutorials.

In the [Tutorials](./Tutorials/) folder, you can find the various notebooks for the three days, divided on the base of their topics. There are also some quiz that you are asked to complete at the end of each session.

Lastly, test yourself with the [GW Data Challenge](./Challenge/)!

## Software setup

At the following link, several options are presented, with the indication of their difficulty and OS dependency. Feel free to pick the one that suits best for your needs.
